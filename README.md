## Important Dependencies (Currently only tested on Ubuntu) ##
* Python 2.7.X
* Python 3.4.X
* Python.h (apt-get install python-dev/python3-dev)
* pip/pip3 (Depending on what version of Python you choose to run)
* python-dbus/python3-dbus (apt-get install python-dbus/python3-dbus)
* Lua 5.3.X
* Luarocks (Package Manager | Most recent version)
* dbus.h and dbus-arch-deps.h (apt-get -y install dbus libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-2 libdbus-glib-1-dev)
* Linux environment that allows symlinking

## Other important things to have ##
* A valid can database file (*.dbc) so you can input into our dbus can object simulator for tests (Has default fake emulator)
* A running RVI node running the most recent code. Preferably release 0.5.0. https://github.com/pdxostc/rvi_core


## Installing Environment ##
Make sure that all dependencies are met before continuing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PDXostc/rvi_dynamic_agents.git

cd rvi_dynamic_agents

sudo <pip | pip3 > install -r ./deps/python/python_requirements.txt

sudo luarocks install ./deps/lua/ldbus-scm-0.rockspec DBUS_INCDIR=/<path>/<to>/dbus.h DBUS_ARCH_INCDIR=/<path>/<to>/dbus-arch-deps.h

sudo luarocks install ./deps/lua/lua-cjson-2.1devel-1.rockspec

sudo luarocks install ./deps/lua/luasocket-scm-0.rockspec

sudo luarocks install ./deps/lua-websockets-scm-1.rockspec

```

## Setting Configurations ##
* Check the agent_handler_config.py settings file.
* Check the Lua sandbox environment in ./src/lua_libraries/lua_init.lua
* Add in any dbus signals in ./src/lua_libraries/agent.lua
* In the src/lua_libraries/rvi.lua CHANGE THE uuid to a uuid you can match or else we will use the default RVI uuid which takes the "root=UUID=" found in /proc/cmdline

## Running checks ##
After setting up all configuration files and the lua_init.lua file looks good you can now run a very rudimentary smoketest to see if all your libraries have been installed correctly. The smoketest does a few things. First it instantiates a fake dbus object that the agent.lua file is expecting with dummy data. Second it registers a smoketest local RVI service which we will invoke. Then it launches a bad script which tries to require the os package to call direct command line controls which should fail. Then it launches a proper dynamic agent script which is listening on the dbus for the dummy messages and will send a message to our smoktest service to trigger the final A-OK check. This will tell you weather or not the smoketest succeeded or failed.

You can run the smoketest by running this command.
```bash
./test/smoketest
```

A correct output should look like this:
```
Please make sure you have edited the send_proper.lua file with your host prefix e.x. genivi.org/vin/ubuntu/
Continue [Y/N]: Y
Please enter RVI websocket server port(Default is 9008): 9008
Websocket port inputted: 9008
Please enter in your Lua interpreter path(Default would be '/usr/local/bin/lua'): /usr/local/bin/lua 
Given lua interpreter path: /usr/local/bin/lua
Does the above information entered look correct?

## Client Side Deployment ##
**NOTE: If you run the agent_handler as root you must make sure that your dbus session objects are also being run as root or else you will not be able to find them on the dbus!**

Edit the agent_handler_config.py file. You can change the name of the registered services and the RVI_WS_HOST is probably the most important setting to change to reflect what your actual node is using for the websocket server port.

If you wish to add additional signals into the agent sandbox for the time being you must do so manually in the ./src/lua/agent.lua file in the section "DBus signals to subscribe to" section.

To run the agent_handler you can set up systemd integration or simply a crontab since it is fairly resistant. To launch the agent_handler manually just call the command "python/python3 ./src/agent_handler.py" and then you can invoke the RVI services which will then handle your agents.

If you need a fake dbus object for the agent.lua file to load there is one located in ./src/test_utilities/fake_can_dbus_object.py 
You can use Python2 or Python3 to run this dbus object and now the sandbox environment should be able to be launched. 

## Deploying Agents ##
The current agent_handler code will spawn 2 RVI services. These 2 services are described below and what they are expected to have passed in.

```
<RVI_PREFIX>/dynamicagents/agent
Expected Parameters:
	agent = {
		Expected Type = String
		Description = A symbolic name of the agent we will be registering. This will be translated to the agent_id in how we reference the agents internally.
	}
	expires = {
		Expected Type = String or Float or Int of Unix Epoch time
		Description = A Unix Epoch time of when the agent should self terminate. 
	}
	agent_code = {
		Expected Type = Base64 Encoded String
		Description = The actual executable Lua code that is Base64 Encoded of UTF-8 Encoding. Expected Python encoding method is "base64.b64encode(<CODESTRING>.encode('UTF-8'))"
	}
	launch = { //NOT CURRENTLY USED
		Expected Type = String
		Description = Launch command of the script. Currently not used since we only support Lua sandboxing but future iterations may support all types of languages!
	}



<RVI_PREFIX>/dynamicagents/terminate_agent
Expected Parameters:
	agent = {
		Expected Type = String
		Description = A symbolic name of the agent we will be registering. This will be translated to the agent_id in how we reference the agents internally. Same agent string we used to register the agent on the client.
	}

```

## Current Agent API ##
The default Lua sandbox environment at the current moment can be found in the ./src/lua_libraries/lua_init.lua file. The 4 additional libraries that are include in addition to the base runtime environment are as follow:

The agent.lua API will be heavily modified in the near future when we get more defined standards of how we wish to pass messages between different services. 

```
cjson: 
	Documentation can be found at http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson-manual.html

time:
	time.time() = {
		Expected Parameters:
			None

		Return = Unix Epoch timestamp with millisecond precision
	}
	time.sleep(n) = {
		Expected Parameters:
			n = {
				Expected Type = int | float
				Description = Number of seconds you wish your agent to sleep for
			}

		Return = void, agent process will sleep for specified number of seconds
	}

rvi:
	rvi.message(service,payload) = {
		Expected Parameters:
			service = {
				Expected Type = String
				Description = Target rvi service endpoint which you wish to send a message to. AKA a logging RVI service endpoint would be ideal.
			}
			payload = {
				Expected Type = Table
				Description = Table that is able to be cast into a JSON string. This can contain key values which you wish to report back to the backend server.
			}

		Return = True | False , depending on success or failure of message send
	}

agent:
	agent.medium_speed_can_table = Table to current medium speed can table value which was given by a invoked method call.

	agent.dbus_connected() = {
		Expected Parameters:
			None

		Return = True, Will block until True is returned thus notifying that there is something in the dbus message queue.
		Note = It would be best to use this as the main event loop i.e. while agent.dbus_connected() do...
	}

	agent.get_event() = {
		Expected Parameters:
			None
		Return = Table that will look like this:
			{
				signal_type = 'VEHICLE_SIGNAL',
				signal_id = int signal id,
				sig_value = int or float value,
			}
	}

	agent.signal_subscribe(sub) = {
		Expected Parameters:
			sub = interface to subscribe to, to listen for signals
		Return = Void
	}

```

Typical Event Loop code:
```Lua
while agent.dbus_connected() do 
	local msg = agent.get_event()

	-- Do something with the msg for example--	
	agent.medium_speed_can_table[signal] compare with msg[sig_value]

	...
	if condition do
		rvi.message(<service>, {a='b', c='d'})
	end
end
```
